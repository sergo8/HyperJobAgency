<p>Success! We did it, and the online service is up and running. HyperJob is now receiving dozens of emails and phone calls; however, some of the job hunters are complaining as they still cannot log in to publish their resumes.</p>
<p>You receive an email from the CTO of HyperJob:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">FROM: official@hyperjob.com
TO: you@hyperjob.com
DATE: today
SUBJECT: Thanks for the great work

Congratulations, weâ€™ve made a really important step. Great job, we are proud to have such professionals in our team! Could you start working on user authentication next?</code></pre>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Your task is to implement authentication on the website. You need to create three pages: one for new users to sign up and create their accounts, another to log in with their username and password, and the last one to log out. For logging out, users do not need to send any information, so they should just go to the right URL.</p>
<p>Please use <code class="language-html">django.contrib.auth.forms.UserCreationForm</code> for your signup handler, <code class="language-html">django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm</code> or <code class="language-html">django.contrib.auth.views.LoginView</code> for the login handler, and <code class="language-html">django.contrib.auth.views.LogoutView</code> for logout.</p>
<p>If the login request is successful, redirect the user to the menu page.</p>
<p>If you start the application on your computer with the <code class="language-html">python manage.py runserver</code> command, the signup page should be available at the address <code class="language-html">localhost:8000/signup</code> , the login page should be at <code class="language-html">localhost:8000/login</code>, and the logout at <code class="language-html">localhost:8000/logout</code>.</p>
<p>Please pay attention that the URLs do not have a slash at the end, so your URL patterns should not have it either. You can redirect GET requests to the right page with the help of <code class="language-html">RedirectView</code> if you need to:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from django.views.generic import RedirectView
 
urlpatterns = [
   # some other patterns
   path('login/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/login')),
   path('logout/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/logout')),
   path('signup/', RedirectView.as_view(url='/signup')),
]</code></pre></body></html>
